        <h1>Software Engineer</h1> 
            <p>
                A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software.
                Prior to the mid-1970s, software practitioners generally called themselves computer scientists, computer programmers or software developers, regardless of their actual jobs. Many people prefer to call themselves software developer and programmer, because most widely agree what these terms mean, while the exact meaning of software engineer is still being debated.

                Half of all practitioners today have degrees in computer science, information systems, or information technology. A small, but growing, number of practitioners have software engineering degrees. In 1987, the Department of Computing at Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering Bachelor's degree in the UK and the world; in the following year, the University of Sheffield established a similar program.[1] In 1996, the Rochester Institute of Technology

                Meinhard Moser (1924â€“2002) was an Austrian mycologist. His work principally concerned the taxonomy, chemistry, and toxicity of gilled mushrooms (Agaricales), especially the genus Cortinarius. Moser completed his doctorate at the University of Innsbruck in 1950, then briefly worked in England. He joined Austria's Federal Forestry Research Institute in 1952, conducting research on the use of mycorrhizal fungi in reforestation.

                He was an influential mycologist, describing around 500 new fungal taxa and publishing several important books. In particular, his 1953 book on European mushrooms, published in English as Keys to Agarics and Boleti, saw several editions both in German and in translation.
